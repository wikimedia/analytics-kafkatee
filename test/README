Automated regression tests for kafkatee
=======================================

Each test is implemented as a standard kafkatee configuration file named
"test-*.conf".

A local configuration file must be written, use local.conf.example as template.


Run all tests:

   make


Run specific tests:

    TESTS="first.conf second.conf" make




Prerequisits:
* Kafka broker where the topic "kafkatee_test" exists with 10 partitions.
* A configuration file for local configuration: local.conf
* The rdkafka_example tool from librdkafka must be in $PATH


Tools:
* testpipe.py generates input for kafkatee and checks the output from it,
  verifying the number of messages, contents and order.
* linecnt simply counts the number of lines received and performs better
  than testpipe.py
* ingen generates simple input and performs better than testpipe.py
